The structure below is one possible setup for a report stemming from a data analysis project. It loosely follows the structure of a standard scientific manuscript. Adjust as needed. 
You don't need to have exactly these sections, but the content covering those sections should be addressed.

This uses [HTML as output format](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html). See [the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/) for instructions on how to use other formats.


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# load a few R packages
library(here)
library(knitr)
```

# Methods 

The dataset was loaded from the processed-data folder using the `here` package. Linear regression models were fit using the `lm()` function.
The first one is a linear model with height as the outcome and weight as the predictor. The secone one is a multiple linear model with height as the outcome and weight and gender as predictors. The third one is a few linear models with height as the outcome and study time and exercise time as predictors.
Model results were cleaned up using the `broom` package and saved as RDS files in the results/tables folder.
Figures generated during analysis were saved to the results/figures folder.

# Results
```{r}
library(here)

# Load saved tables
result1 <- readRDS(here("results", "tables", "resulttable1.rds"))
result2 <- readRDS(here("results", "tables", "resulttable2.rds"))
result3 <- readRDS(here("results", "tables", "resulttable3.rds"))

result1
result2
result3
```

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis
```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table. All caption text goes here."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable <- readRDS("../../results/tables/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```

## Full analysis

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 <- readRDS(here("results","tables","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```
